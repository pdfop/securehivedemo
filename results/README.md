This directory contains the results for all the case studies presented in the paper.  
All numbers represent the response time of system in milliseconds. 
Response time is definded as the System.nanoTime() difference between the creation of the list of parameters for a DeviceNotification and the decryption of the parameters of the DeviceCommand that represents the direct response to that notification.   
All tests were performed on the Azure cloud setup described in the paper.
